.SH NAME
maqao-madras \- manual page for maqao madras module.
.SH SYNOPSIS
maqao madras <filename> ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
The maqao madras module is a program used to test and use some functionalities of libmadras.Today, it allows the user to disassemble a file (such as objdump, from GNU Binutils), get dataon the ELF structure (such as readelf, also from GNU Binutils). It also allows the user to patcha binary (for the moment, only a simple function insertion can be done, but more features willbe added in next releases).

\fB\-\-raw-start\fR\=<offset>
[Raw disassembly option] Starts disassembly after <offset> bytes (0 if not set).

\fB\-\-raw-len\fR\=<len>
[Raw disassembly option] Disassembles <len> bytes (whole file if not set or set to 0). Ignored if raw-stop is used.
.TP
\fB\-\-raw-stop\fR\=<offset>
[Raw disassembly option] Stops disassembly at <offset> bytes (whole file if not set or set to 0). Ignored if raw-len is used.

\fB\-\-raw-first\fR\=<addr>
[Raw disassembly option] Assigns address <addr> to the first disassembled instruction (0 if not set).
.TP
\fB\-\-with-family\fR[\=]

.TP
\fB\-\-with-annotate\fR[\=]
Adds instruction annotations during printing (for testing purpose).
.TP
\fB\-\-with-roles\fR[\=]
Adds instruction roles during printing (for testing purpose).
.TP
\fB\-\-with-isets\fR[\=]
Adds instruction sets during printing (for testing purpose).
.TP
\fB\-\-with-debug\fR[\=]
Prints debug informations from the file (if available and retrieved).
.TP
\fB\-\-no-debug\fR[\=]
Does not attempt to retrieve debug informations from the file.
.TP
\fB\-\-print-all-labels\fR[\=]
Prints all labels found in the code, not only those identifying functions.
.SH "    BINARY FILE DATA"
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-printelf\fR[\=]
Prints ELF structures. Filters can be used to print only a part of ELF data. If no filters are set, all data are printed. Else, only specified data are printed.

Prints ELF dynamic tables.
.TP
\fB\-\-elfsym\fR[\=]
Prints ELF symbol tables.
.TP
\fB\-\-elfver\fR[\=]
Prints ELF version tables.
.TP
\fB\-\-elf-code-areas\fR[\=]
Prints the start, length and stop of consecutive sections containing executable code in the file. Mainly for helping use of raw-disass.
.TP
\fB\-\-get-external-fct\fR[\=]
Gets external functions using ELF data.
.TP
\fB\-\-get-dynamic-lib\fR[\=]
Gets dynamic libraries using ELF data.
.TP

Prints the instructions sets present in the file.
.TP
\fB\-\-print-file-debug-info\fR[\=]
Prints the debug information available at the file level.
.SH "    ASSEMBLING"
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-assemble-insn\fR\=<arch>
Assembles the instruction and prints the corresponding binary code (in hexadecimal) <arch> is the architecture to use for assembling In this cas, <filename> is interpreted as an assembly instruction (written in AT&T format for Intel architecture)
.TP
\fB\-A\fR, \fB\-\-assemble-file\fR\=<arch>
Assembles the instructions found in <filename> and prints the corresponding binary code (in hexadecimal) <arch> is the architecture to use for assembling
.SH "    PATCHING"
.TP
\fB\-\-function\fR\=<format>
Inserts a function call. The function does not have any parameters. <format> is a quote-delimited string containing parameters used to insert the function. It has the following structure: <fct name>;[@<address>[@<address>...]][;<library>][;<after|before>][;<wrap|no-wrap>] <fct name> is the name of the function to insert, <address> is where to put the function. If not specified, the function is inserted but not called, <library> is a dynamic library containing the function. If not specified, it is assumed that <function name> is an internal function and a call is added to the function, <after|before> can be used to choose if the call is done at the instruction before or after <address>. <before> is the default choice, <wrap-no-wrap> can be used to choose if the context must be save before the function call. <wrap> is the default choice. The stack saving behavior can be set used --stack-... options. --stack-shift=512 is the default behaviour.
.TP
\fB\-\-delete\fR\=<format>
Deletes one or several instructions. The <format> parameter has the following structure: @<address>[@<address>...][;<number>] <address> is where to delete instructions, <number> is the number of instruction to delete. If not specified, the default value is 1. <number> must be a positive value.
.TP
\fB\-\-stack-keep\fR[\=]
Sets the method for safeguarding the stack to STACK_KEEP (original stack is kept).
.TP
\fB\-\-stack-move\fR[\=]
Sets the method for safeguarding the stack to STACK_MOVE (stack is moved to new location).
.TP

For ELF binaries, changes the machine data by <value> in the ELF header.
.TP
\fB\-\-rename-library\fR\=<format>
Rename an external library referenced in the binary. <format> is a quote-delimited with the following structure: <oldname>;<newname> where <oldname> is the name of an existing library referenced in the binary, and <newname> is the name with which it must be replaced.
.SH "    OTHER"
.TP
\fB\-\-check-file\fR[\=]
Check the binary is valid.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\fR\=<output>
Saves the file in <output>. If no patching command has been issued, the new file will be identical. If omitted while a patching command has been issued, the result file will be <filename>_mdrs.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-mute\fR[\=]
Disassembles but does not print anything.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR[\=]
Prints this message.
